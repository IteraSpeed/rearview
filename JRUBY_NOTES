To allow scripts in the jruby package to be run with gems resolved, a jar must be built which
contains gem file structure and inserted into the classpath.

To update lib/ruby-gems.jar perform the following steps:

 - Edit ./jruby/Gemfile adding whatever gems you need
 - Run the package script: ./jruby/update-gems.sh

 The lib/ruby-gems.jar file should now be updated with the latest gems.
